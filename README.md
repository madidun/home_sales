Module 22 Challenge


Project Description: First, I imported the latest spark version and java. Then I read the data and created a temporary view of the dataframe. I found the average price for a four bedroom house sold in each year and adjusted the code differently so it can answer the remaining questions. I was having a hard time running run the query that filters out the view ratings with average price greater than or equal to $350,000. Then I was not able to runtime to the cached time.
