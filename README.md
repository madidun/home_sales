# home_sales

Module 22 Challenge


Project Description: First, I imported the latest spark version and java. Then I read the data and created a temporary view of the dataframe. I found the average price for a four bedroom house sold in each year and adjusted the code differently so it can answer the remaining questions. I was having a hard time running run the query that filters out the view ratings with average price greater than or equal to $350,000. Then I was not able to runtime to the cached time. I later partitioned by the "date_built" field on the formatted parquet home sales data. Most of the challenges in this project came from installing spark and java. Installing the right packages was also tough. A lot of the code was repetitive I then had to change it for the different questions.
